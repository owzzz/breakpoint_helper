Breakpoint Helper
=================

Having a hard time knowing when styles are taking effect? Breakpoint helper is a useful and simple tool for displaying current breakpoints in the browser based on your sass breakpoint variables.

## Installation
Simply update the breakpoints and color based variables in the breakpoint_helper.scss to match your project requirements and then import the breakpoint_helper.scss file into your project. 


### Running Demo
To run a simple demo:

```javascript
 git clone https://github.com/owzzz/breakpoint_helper.git
```

```javascript
 cd breakpoint_helper
```


#### Gather dependencies

```javascript
 npm install
```

#### Compile sass

```javascript
 gulp
```

open ```index.html``` in browser


## Installing with Bower
If you'd like to grab just the scss file without the demo folder then you can use Bower.

```javascript
 bower install breakpoint_helper 
```
